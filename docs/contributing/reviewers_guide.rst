Review workflow
---------------

.. important::

    The reviewing process is a collaboration between the contributor and the reviewer and should always be conducted with respect. All contributions are valuable, and reviewers should always explain their reasons for requesting changes or rejecting a pull request.

Once a pull request is submitted, reviewers will ensures that the proposed changes adhere to the guidelines provided. As a reviewer, you will need to test the code to verify that everything is in order and request changes if necessary. To do so, create a local branch from the pull request ::

    git fetch origin pull/<PULL NUMBER>/head:<BRANCH NAME>

where ``<PULL NUMBER>`` is the number of the pull request and ``<BRANCH NAME>`` is the name you assign to the local branch you are creating. Here is a checklist to guide your review :

* Unit tests have been added and/or modified.
* All unit tests pass succesfully.
* The documentation builds with no errors or warnings.
* The relevant sections of the documentation are complete and accurate.
* Docstrings are clear and comprehensive.
* The pull request correctly links to the related issue, if applicable.

Once the review is complete, if it has not already been done, you can ask for the PR issuer to add a short release note to the ``docs/release_notes/upcoming_changes`` directory. If everything is satisfactory, give your approval and tag one of the maintainers to merge the pull request.

Release workflow
----------------

.. note::

    We use the following versioning notation:

    ``X.Y.Z`` where

    - ``X`` is a **major** version
    - ``Y`` is a **minor** version
    - ``Z`` is a **patch** version

    Note also:

    - ``X.Y+1`` is the futur minor version
    - ``X.Y.Z-1`` is the previous patch version

Major/minor version release workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are the step to make a major or minor release:

1. Once a milestone is almost completed, a new branch ``maintenance/X.Y.x`` is created and the final preparations before the release will be merged into this branch and the ``vX.Y.0`` tag will be created from this branch.
2. Update the documentation.

   * Merge the previous ``doc/X.Y-1.Z`` branch into the branch you are going to tag on **without deleting** the branch.
   * Remove ``.dev`` from the ``__version__`` in ``_version.py``.
   * If relevant, add a ``highlights.rst`` file with a bulleted list of highlights for the release.
   * Build the documentation site locally (:ref:`see how to build the documentation <builddoc>`)
   * Empty the ``doc/release_notes/upcoming_changes`` directory.
   * Update the ``switcher.json`` file to add a new documentation version with the following values: ::
     
       {
           "name": "X.Y",
           "version": "X.Y.0",
           "url": "https://www.graphinglib.org/doc-X.Y.0/",
           "preferred": true
       }
    
     Remove the ``"preferred": true`` for the previous version.
   * Rebuild the documentation to make sure it builds without problems.

3. Draft a release on GitHub. Copy the release notes from the documentation and adapt the syntax for Markdown.
4. Create the ``vX.Y.0`` tag.
5. Merge the ``maintenance/X.Y.x`` (branch without deleting it) to the ``main`` branch. Bump version to ``X.Y+1.0`` (or ``X+1.0.0`` for major version) in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.py``. Bump ``__version__`` to ``X.Y+1.0.dev`` in ``_version.py``.
6. Create a new ``doc/X.Y.0`` branch from the ``maintenance/X.Y.0`` branch. Change the GraphingLib's source URL in ``requirements.txt`` to ``git+https://github.com/GraphingLib/GraphingLib@doc/X.Y.0``.
7. Manually trigger a build of the "latest" version on *Read the Docs* to update the project. Activate the version ``doc/X.Y.0`` and make it the default version in the admin settings.
8. Bump ``__version__`` to ``X.Y.1`` in ``_version.py``. 

Patch version release workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attention::

    For a patch release, no updates are made on the ``main`` branch. If a bug correction has to be also applied to the next major/minor release see :ref:`the section on backporting <backporting>`.

Here are the step to make a patch release:

1. Update the documentation.

   * Merge the previous ``doc/X.Y.Z-1`` branch into the ``maintenance/X.Y.x`` branch and **delete** the old documentation branch
   * Bump ``__version__`` from ``X.Y.Z-1`` to ``X.Y.Z`` in ``_version.py``.
   * Build the documentation site locally (:ref:`see how to build the documentation <builddoc>`)
   * If relevant, add a ``highlights.rst`` file with a bulleted list of highlights for the release.
   * Empty the ``doc/release_notes/upcoming_changes`` directory.
   * Update the ``switcher.json`` file to bump the ``"version"`` key of the ``X.Y.Z-1`` version to ``X.Y.Z`` and the ``"url"`` from ``/doc-X.Y.Z-1/`` to ``/doc-X.Y.Z/``. The ``"preferred"`` configuration is **left untouched**.
   * Rebuild the documentation to make sure it builds without problems.

2. Draft a release on GitHub. Copy the release notes from the documentation and adapt the syntax for Markdown.
3. Create the ``vX.Y.Z`` tag.
4. Create a new ``doc/X.Y.Z`` branch from the ``maintenance/X.Y.Z`` branch.
5. Bump version to ``X.Y.Z+1`` in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.py``
6. Manually trigger a build of the "latest" version on *Read the Docs* to update the project. If the version ``doc-X.Y.Z-1`` is still active, deactivate it. Activate the ``doc-X.Y.Z`` version. If this patch release is on the **latest major/minor version**, set this new version as default in admin settings, else no changes necessary.

.. _backporting:

Backporting changes to other branches
-------------------------------------

In the case of bug fixes made in a ``maintenance/X.Y.Z`` branch, the fix most likely has to be made in the ``main`` branch. This is where backporting comes in: you can "copy-paste" commits from the maintenance branch to the main branch by using ``git cherry-pick``.

.. warning::

   Using ``git cherry-pick`` can cause chaos in a repository if not used properly. Prioritise merging instead of cherry-picking whenever possible.

Here is a case where merging is not possible and cherry-picking has to be used ::

    main --- A --- B --- F --- G --- H
                    \
    maintenance      C --- D --- E

Say in this case, we are working on the ``main`` branch, adding features for the next minor/major release, and we find a bug in the code dating back to before the divergence of the ``maintenance`` branch. In this case, we could fix the bug in the ``main`` branch, say in commit ``H``, but to apply those changes in the maintenance branch **without** adding any new features developped on the ``main`` branch, say commits ``F`` and ``G``, we use cherry-picking.

First, make sure you checkout the ``maintenance`` branch in which you want to move the commit containing the bugfix ::

    git checkout maintenance

Next, cherry-pick the commit by using its hash (which you can find using ``git log`` for example) ::

    git cherry-pick H

At this point it is possible that there will be conflicts for you to resolve. Once the conflicts are resolved, you should have the following branch graph ::

    main --- A --- B --- F --- G --- H
                    \
    maintenance      C --- D --- E --- H
                                       ^
                                applied bugfix
